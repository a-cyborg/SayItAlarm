    <string name="info_about">
        Have you ever wanted your first waking thought to be about something you deeply desire? or
        Have you ever wanted to start a day with a bit more passion?\n\n
        SayItAlarm is born for this, but also if \n\n
        Have you ever woken up immediately when the worries from last night come up? or
        Have you ever felt hopeless when you woke up?\n\n
        To me, all the time SayIt helped me, I wish it could help you too.
        It\'s all about SayIt, but If I may add something more…\n\n
        SayIt is an open-source project. You can read the entire application code on GitHub.\n\n
        As SayIt does not collect any data, it\'s hard to identify problems. Please report any issues by writing a review on Google Play or emailing me.\n\n
        Also, I like to receive emails if you have anything to tell me. Please feel free to email me.\n\n
        Love,\n
        Mima
